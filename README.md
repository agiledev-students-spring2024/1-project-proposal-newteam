### Project title

VolunteerMatch

### What and why?

This software would help individuals seeking volunteer opportunities and non-profit organizations in need of help. This addresses the problem that many face in finding volunteering oportunities that align with their skills, interest, and availability. This often discourages potential volunteers as it is hard to find organizations you truly care for. By creating an efficient platform that matches volunteers with organizations we can help individuals make a positive impact on the world.

### For whom?

Individuals seeking volunteer opportunities: This includes anyone who wants to help give back to the community and volunteer. The system will cater to people with different interest and avaliabitilty. 

Non-profit organizations and community groups: These organizations are always in need of volunteers and this platform will help them find them by making a centralized platform.

### How?

Volunteer end: The user can search and input filters of interest, skills, avaliability. They can view organization websites and oppertunities.

Organization end: Organizations can create profiles showcasing their mission, needs, and events. They can post opportunities and link to applications.

### Scope

This application is suitable for 4-6 programmers. The core functionalities of profile management, search and matching algorithms, communication interfaces are complex but well within the ability of a team of programmers. This application also allows for plenty of room for new functionality and features.
